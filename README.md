# Traffic_Sign
This Traffic Sign Detection project is designed to automatically identify and classify road signs from custom image inputs using deep learning and computer vision techniques. 
# ðŸš¦ Traffic Sign Detection using YOLO, ResNet50, and Ensemble Learning

This project aims to detect and classify traffic signs using a custom dataset of 42 traffic sign labels. It combines classical deep learning with object detection (YOLO), ResNet50, and ensemble modeling to improve accuracy and performance.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Real-time traffic sign detection using YOLOv4/v5
- Classification using ResNet50 and Scikit-learn ensemble methods
- Supports custom images (42 labels)
- High-accuracy YOLO detection pipeline
- Modular Python scripts for training, prediction, and ensemble analysis

## ðŸ§  Model Performance

| Model         | Accuracy |
|---------------|----------|
| YOLO          | 89%      |
| ResNet50      | 70%      |
| Ensemble Model| 80%      |
